# downlaw

Write markdown with legal citations on the left, get rendered markdown on the right. Oh, and the legal citations become links.

See the demo: http://adelevie.github.io/downlaw/

## Contribute!

Add your favorite legal citation to the default text by editing [`build/app.js`](https://github.com/adelevie/downlaw/blob/master/build/app.js#L104).

### Dev notes

Pull requests are welcome. File an issue if you have any questions.

Gulp does not work. 

I use a manual [tool](http://facebook.github.io/react/jsx-compiler.html) to generate js from jsx. One day this will be automated.
