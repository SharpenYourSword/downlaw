# downlaw

Write markdown with legal citations on the left, get rendered markdown on the right. Oh, and the legal citations become links.

See the demo: http://adelevie.github.io/downlaw/index.html

### Dev notes

Pull requests are welcome. File an issue if you have any questions.

Gulp does not work. 

I manually copy `src/app.jsx` [here](http://facebook.github.io/react/jsx-compiler.html) and paste into `build/app.js`.
